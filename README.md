## 1. Preparing the Dataset  

To ensure robust encryption and evaluation, we first prepare the datasets used in this study. The selected datasets include:  

### Datasets  
- **Brain Tumors Dataset**  
  - A medical imaging dataset containing brain tumor scans.  
  - Used for testing encryption robustness in medical image security.  

- **Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) Dataset**  
  - A dataset of chest X-ray images for automated disease classification.  
  - Utilized to evaluate the impact of encryption on deep ensemble learning models.  

## 2. Encrypting and Obtaining the Outputs  

Once the datasets are prepared, the next step is to apply the encryption algorithm to transform the images.  

- Run **`encrypt.m`** to execute the encryption process.  
- After execution, the encrypted images are generated and stored for further analysis.  
- The encrypted outputs can be used for **security validation, decryption testing, and performance evaluation**.  

This encryption process ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive medical images while enabling secure AI-driven diagnostics.
